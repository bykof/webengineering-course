# Conditional Rendering

As we can understand from the term, conditional rendering is a way to render different JSX or component at different condition. We can implement conditional rendering using regular if and else statement, ternary operator and &&. Let's implement a different conditional rendering.

## Conditional Rendering using If and Else statement

The problem with using if and else statements is that you are not allowed to use hooks afterwards.

!!! example

    ```js
    const Component = ({ isAllowed }) => {
        if (isAllowed) {
            return <p>You are allowed</p>
        }
        return <p>You are not allowed!</p>
    }
    ```

An if- and else statement inside a React component is done mostly at the bottom of the component.
See an example here:

!!! example

    ```js
    const Component = () => {
        const { isLoggedIn, isLoading } = React.useContext(AuthenticationContext)
        const [someState, setSomeState] = React.useState(false)

        if (!isLoggedIn) {
            return <p>You are not allowed to see this</p>
        }

        if (!isLoading) {
            return <p>Loading...</p>
        }

        return (
            <p
                onClick={() => {
                    setSomeState(!someState)
                }}
            >
                Currently its: {someState}
            </p>
        )
    }
    ```

## Ternary operator

In most cases you want to switch inside your component between different views.
Therefore you will use the [conditional operator](https://javascript.info/ifelse#conditional-operator) the [OR operator](https://javascript.info/ifelse#conditional-operator) or the [AND Operator](https://javascript.info/ifelse#conditional-operator).

Here are some examples:

!!! example

    ```js
    const Component = ({ isAllowed }) => {
        return (
            <div>
                <h1>Here is a title</h1>
                <p>You are {isAllowed ? 'allowed' : 'not allowed'} to enter</p>
            </div>
        )
    }
    ```

!!! example

    ```js
    const Component = ({ isAllowed }) => {
        return (
            <div>
                <h1>Here is a title</h1>
                <p>You are {!isAllowed && 'not'} allowed to enter</p>
            </div>
        )
    }
    ```

!!! example

    ```js
    const Component = ({ value, defaultValue }) => {
        return (
            <div>
                <h1>Here is a title</h1>
                <p>{value || defaultValue}</p>
            </div>
        )
    }
    ```
