# Custom Hooks

Lets image you want to have a scroll tracker in a lot of components, but you don't want to implement it in every component.
Therefore you can implement a custom hook to outsource the logic and have a "reactive" hook.

     style="width:100%; height:600px; border:0; border-radius: 4px; overflow:hidden;"
     title="reverent-shadow-kv54k8"
     allow="accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; camera; encrypted-media; geolocation; gyroscope; hid; microphone; midi; payment; usb; vr; xr-spatial-tracking"
     sandbox="allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts"
   ></iframe>
