# Variables

We use _var_, _let_ and _const_ to declare a variable. The _var_ is functions scope, however _let_ and _const_ are block scope. In this challenge we use ES6 and above features of JavaScript. 

**Avoid using _var_.**

```js
let firstName = "Asabeneh";
firstName = "Eyob";

const PI = 3.14; // Not allowed to reassign PI to a new value
// PI = 3.
```
